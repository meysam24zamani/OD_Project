Assumption: Due to not having access to the ontology on the second set of queries, 
one way of adapting the queries is to filter all classes in the environment and
finding the required ones according to their name (converted to String). While in some
situations this might retrieve information from unrelated sources, we assume and we made
sure to filter them in a way that these classes contain the information needed without 
referencing the TBOX.
